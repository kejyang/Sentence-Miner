# Sentence-Miner

### Introduction

Sentence mining is a language learning strategy. Instead of learning words individually, words are learned in context in sentences. This helps the learner 
to internalize meanings much faster and also in the process learn useful sentences to use. Generally, there should only be one unknown word to the learner,
as adding too many words will simply confuse the learner. This application helps the learner organize their sentences to mine.
